        Bit 0 is the IsVirtual flag that indicates physical or virtual
        mapping:
          - 0 -- The shared memory address provided in
                 apm_shared_map_region_payload_t is a physical address. The
                 shared memory must be mapped (a hardware TLB entry), and a
                 software entry must be added for internal bookkeeping.

          - 1 -- The shared memory address provided in the map
                 payload[usRegions] is a virtual address. The shared memory
                 must not be mapped (because the hardware TLB entry is already
                 available), but a software entry must be added for internal
                 bookkeeping. \n
                 This bit value (1) is useful if two services within the aDSP
                 are communicating via the APR. They can directly communicate
                 via the virtual address instead of the physical address. The
                 virtual regions must be contiguous.

        Bit 1 - is_uncached - indicates whether the memory must be mapped as cached memory or uncached.
              Note: most memories must be mapped as cached. Some special cases need uncached memory.
           - 0  - cached.
           - 1  - uncached.

        Bit 2 - is_offset_mode -  indicates whether the memory will be subsequently referred to with offsets.
        After mapping a physical region using this command, a mem-map-handle is returned.
        Subsequently the client uses mem-map-handle in any command that uses addresses/offsets
        belonging to memory region mapped in this command.
           - 0 - subsequent commands using mem-map-handle returned by APM_CMD_RSP_SHARED_MEM_MAP_REGIONS,
                 will use physical or virtual addresses
                 (E.g. buf_addr_lsw & buf_addr_msw in data_cmd_wr_sh_mem_ep_data_buffer_t will be phy or virt addresses).
           - 1 - subsequent commands using mem-map-handle returned by APM_CMD_RSP_SHARED_MEM_MAP_REGIONS,
                 will use offsets. (E.g. buf_addr_lsw & buf_addr_msw in data_cmd_wr_sh_mem_ep_data_buffer_t will be offsets).
                 The offset is from the base address.
                 Base address is defined as the address given by the apm_shared_map_region_payload_t.
        Bit 3 - is_client_loaned_memory – specifies if the client manages the memory or allows the APM to manage the memory.
        The Client owned memory, the shared memory is managed by the client. 
        The Client loaned memory, the shared memory is mapped by the client and managed by APM.  
            0 – Client owned memory 
            1 – Client Loaned memory
                Incase of loaned memory, client would need to relinquish the memory access permissions for MDF usecases.
