/** @ingroup prm_cmd_request_hw_rsc
  - This API is used by client for requesting the single h/w resource ID
  - Command payload depends upon the resource ID and it may vary for
  different resource types
  - A single resource ID may encompass multiple instances of that resource
  - From client perspective, it is possible to request multiple such instances
  using a single command
  - Multiple resources ID request cannot be clubbed together in a single command.
  Individual command must be sent for requesting each individual resource ID
  - Depending upon resource type, a resource ID may be requested multiple number
  of times as long as the resource configuration is not changed. This is possible
  if there are multiple unique clients on HLOS side requesting for the same resource ID
  - Multiple request for same resource ID may not be supported for all resources
  - PRM module keeps track of reference counter for each such request

/** @ingroup prm_cmd_release_hw_rsc
  - This API is used by client for releasing the h/w resource requested
  using the PRM_CMD_REQUEST_HW_RSC command
  - This command results in failure if command issued for releasing a
  resource which was not previously requested
  - Number of release commands for a given resource ID must match with
  the number of request commands
  - If the number of release is lesser than number of request, it may result
  in h/w resource to remain ON
  - For resources with multiple instances, release command need not be symmetric
  to release request. For example, client may request 3 clock ID's under a single
  REQUEST command but release maybe be done across 2 or more commands
